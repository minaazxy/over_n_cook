# over_n_cook
This is a mini cooking game that references the game mechanic of Overcook.
This game is highly inspired by the YouTube channel: Code Monkey (https://youtu.be/Aehydn9TJYU?si=rHFJSCUJhb32zNwA)
He provides every instruction to create this game in Unity and also the c# code.

I also create an auto mode for it to automatically cook and deliver by using c++.
In order to run this game (on website), it requires Docker Engine installed on your laptop / computer.
I'm currently developing the multiplayer mode ^^

* btw higher GPU for better and smoother game experience, mac user may be laggy sometimes.
