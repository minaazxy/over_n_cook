## How to Start

### WebGL

1. Go to the top-right corner of this repository and click **Code â†’ Download ZIP**.  
2. Unzip the file, then open the folder in **VSCode**.  
3. In the VSCode terminal, run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

Alternatively, if you are familiar with **Git**, you can quickly set up the game and the C++ server using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iceylemon157/sprout-c-game-2024
   cd sprout-c-game-2024
   docker compose up
   ```

Once the setup is complete, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:12345/app
```

You should now see the game running.

### C++ Server

To start the C++ server:

1. Open a **new terminal**.  
2. Navigate into the `sprout-c-game-2024` folder (the folder you just downloaded or cloned).  
3. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec cpp_server /bin/bash
   # Inside the Docker container:
   make && ./server
   ```

This will compile and launch the C++ server inside the Docker container.

## Reference

- Game assets are mostly from the tutorial by [Code Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg).  
- Many of the C# scripts (for the WebGL build) are also adapted from the tutorial, but have been modified to work with the C++ server.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine  
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended for editing and running commands)  
- (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you want to clone the repository instead of downloading the ZIP

I'm currently woring on the multiplayer mode.
If you just want to play, just download the Docker Engine and the .html file.
